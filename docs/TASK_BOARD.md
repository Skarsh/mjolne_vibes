# Task Board

Current execution board for maintenance work.

## Current focus

- `Maintenance / Hardening`
- `Draw-Command Canvas Platform`

## Active tasks

- [ ] Implement per-turn focus mode (dim unchanged topology; emphasize changed + impact) with tests.
- [ ] Document operator workflow for using studio canvas to review agent changes faster than diffs.

## Backlog candidates

- [ ] Add optional cost/usage counters in turn trace output.
- [ ] Add timeline/snapshot scrubber UI once turn snapshot model is stable.
- [ ] Add configurable subsystem mapping rules (beyond path heuristics) for architecture grouping.

## Archive

- Prior completed-item history is archived in `docs/legacy/2026-02/TASK_BOARD_HISTORY_2026-02-20.md`.

## Board rules
